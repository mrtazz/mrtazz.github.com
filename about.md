## [About]({{page.title}})

I'm a computology practitioner and love working on tools, infrastructure and
helping people ship code. By day I'm writing tools as part of the DevTools
team at [Etsy](http://etsy.com). When I'm not writing code, I'm usually having
breakfast, play basketball or watch TV shows. I also consume coffee and rap
music in moderate to high volumes every day.
