## [{{page.title}}]({{ page.url }})

This year I tried again to keep up the flow of reading books. I'm an awfully
slow reader when it comes to books in general (not so much for blog posts
interestingly) but I managed to read a handful of books and I wanted to share
my thoughts about it. Mostly because I got inspired by reading [Mathias'
reading list][mathias] but also because I wanted to have a track record of
what I read and hopefully inspire myself to read even more next year.

So without further ado, here is my list:

### [Germaine Greer - The Female Eunuch][female_eunuch]
I started the year off with finally finishing Germaine Greer's feminist
classic from 1970 about the role of women in modern society. I had known about
the book for a couple of years and after having read [Bell Hooks' The Will to
Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love][hooks] last year I decided to finally read
it. I definitely enjoyed it. Especially as a man it opens your eyes to a lot
of things you never encounter in your daily life. It's very graphic at times
and there are some long-winded parts in the middle but I would definitely
recommend it to anyone who's interested in feminism. I also started reading
her newest book ["The Whole Woman"][whole_woman] this year which is the sequel
she never wanted to write. And so far I like it and it's alarming how few
things have changed since "The Female Eunuch".

### [Erik Hollnagel - The ETTO Principle: Efficiency-Thoroughness Trade-Off][etto]
It's no secret that I'm interested in [human factors and system
safety][human_error] and how to apply lessons learned to our field of creating
and managing complex computer systems. So it also shouldn't be a surprise that
this book really hit home for me. It's well written and touches on a myriad of
different aspects about how we trade off thoroughness for efficiency and how
production pressure changes our way of making decisions. It's a pretty fast
read and I really enjoyed it. It also has a huge references and related
literature section following each chapter which makes it great to start diving
deeper into the topic.

### [The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win][phoenix]
I originally started reading it in 2013 when it came out and I enjoyed it back
then. But I somehow still dropped the ball and stopped reading it. I finally
went back and finished it this summer. It's a good and interesting read and
having worked in traditional plant production companies I liked a lot of the
parallels in there. It gets a little weird at the end and the last quarter
feels like the authors really had to wrap up the book. And no matter how you
look at it, it's definitely business romanticism. But if you don't mind that,
it's definitely entertaining.

### [Susan Cain - Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking][quiet]
This is another one I started in 2013 and then dropped for no real reason. I
finished it this year and thoroughly enjoyed it. I knew before I started
reading that I fall on the introvert side of the scale but the book really
helped recognizing some more patterns and making me feel better about it. This
is also the only book I finished as a Kindle audiobook and while I likely
won't do it again, it was an interesting experience. It's a great read and
definitely recommended for anyone who works with other humans in their daily
life.

### [Kourosh Dini - Create Flow with OmniFocus 2][of_flow]
This one was kind of a surprise read for me. I've [written before][of_post]
about how much I have OmniFocus is integrated in my life. And when this book
popped up [in one of my RSS feeds][simplicitybliss] I decided to give it a
read. It's definitely not a cheap book and I jumped over the first half as
it's basically an introduction into OmniFocus which I already know how to use.
The book isn't a total game changer, but the latter half gives some good food
for thought on how to make the most of OmniFocus' Perspectives and some
unusual use cases for it.

### [Bonus: Jon Cowie - Customizing Chef][chef]
I added this as a bonus round, because while I definitely read it, I had the
privilege to do so as a reviewer. I'm really happy that [Jon][jcowie] asked me
to review his book and while I had done a lot of Chef before, I learned tons
about its internals from this book. If you work with Chef and want to get more
out of it or even just understand some of the internals a little better,
definitely read this book.


I really enjoyed reading all those books this year. And one of my New Year's
resolutions is definitely to read more next year. I've planned to set some
time aside every day to read and hope to have a longer list of things I read
next year. If not, it sure isn't because of a small Kindle backlog.
