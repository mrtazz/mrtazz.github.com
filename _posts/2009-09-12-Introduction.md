h3. Who am I and where am I coming from

My name is Daniel and at the time of this writing I am 26 year old. Previously I made my diploma-engineer degree "here":http://www.dhbw-loerrach.de and am now a "computer science grad student":http://www.uni-freiburg.de and a "developer for embedded systems":http://www.stzedn.de. I am a happy unix user ever since I made the switch away from Windows in the first year of my undergraduate study. At the moment the unix flavour of my choice is "Mac OS X":http://www.apple/com/macosx.

In my freetime I like to play basketball, watch movies.

I had already given blogging a try some years ago. However after some postings I found myself updating my "wordpress installation":http://www.wordpress.org more often than I actually wrote entries. Eventually I gave up blogging completely. Earlier this year then, I discovered "github.com":http://github.com and the possibility to generate web content with "jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll. Since I had always felt kind of bad for having stopped updating my old site, but never felt like hassling with some blogging platform again, the jekyll system finally felt like the right way to start blogging again. This is why I created this site, which took a great piece of structural inspiration from "al3x.net":http://al3x.net.


h3. What I have in mind for this site

This site will feature all the ideas, for which I will have found the time (or muse) to write them down. Since I am in no way a web designer the look of the site will most likely be held quite simple and not be tested in any possible combination of browser and OS.
