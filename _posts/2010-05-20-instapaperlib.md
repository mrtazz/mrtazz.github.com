For some time now [instapaper.com][instapaper] is one of the web services I use most.
Together with the iPhone application it is the perfect storage place for articles and
blog posts you get via RSS, twitter or from anywhere else. Whenever I don't have time
to read a link right now, I hit my "Read later" bookmark and the article is saved
in pure text form to my instapaper.com account. The same goes for twitter links, Tweetie
(now Twitter for iPhone) has perfectly integrated instapaper so that it could not be
easier to post links for reading later.

However I also wanted to be able to add links quickly which come from other sources.
That is why I wrote a library for instapaper in python and a command line client using
this library. For source code and examples see the [github][githubinstapaper] page and to
install use [PyPi][pypiurl].
