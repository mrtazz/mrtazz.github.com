abstract: "Internal tools aren't known for their beautiful consumer UI, or
extreme ease of use, but they are what keeps any company humming. But this is
changing. Airbnb and Etsy are among a handful of companies leading the way in
developing not only simple, easy to use tools, but also ones that customers
love - and by that I mean colleagues.  These tools make work more efficient and
help everyone at the company deliver the best results. Learn from these
industry leaders on how and why to build great internal tools and they'll share
some of their prized (open source) possessions - Stats D, Deployinator,
Chronos."
