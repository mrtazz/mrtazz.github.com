abstract: "At Etsy we are continuously deploying software with about 50
deploys per day on average. We have about 150 engineers that work together to
add features, improve the site, solve problems, and figure out outages. We are
constantly working on improving ways to collaborate and have the time to
invest into research and new projects instead of fire fighting. However this
hasn't been like this from the beginning. In the Dark Ages of Etsy we had a
vastly different software architecture, a myriad of silos with a less than
ideal amount of communication and a not so stable site. So what happened? How
did we fix this?

We will briefly go over how we changed the architecture and culture to make
site operations and stability better. After that we will go into detail about
what it meant for us to maintain that culture of collaboration and trust and
things we learned from that. And finally take a look at the state of things in
the present and give a comprehensive picture of how we arrived here and where
to go from there. "
