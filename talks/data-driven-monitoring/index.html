abstract: "At Etsy we are big fans of graphing and monitoring all the things.
We deploy our main site several times a day and our monitoring provides us
with the tight feedback loop we need to make this possible. The same goes for
changes in the infrastructure which are deployed in a similar fashion of small
and frequent changes. For this to work we have build up monitoring that tracks
changes and possible problems in every nook and cranny of the Etsy stack, be
it a network change, systems or application level performance or how bad the
last week of on-call rotation was.

The flipside of monitoring all the things however is that we have a myriad of
graphs and alerts that can potentially be important and page the on-call
engineer at any given time. The risk of running into alert fatigue and a
normalization of deviance through not properly scoped checks is rising with
this ever increasing size of the monitoring system. This is why we also
continuously monitor our monitoring system and ask questions about whether we
have all the information at hand when we get paged, if certain alerts actually
need to wake someone up or if they are needed at all.

I will give a quick overview of how our monitoring stack is built and then
give insights into how we gather data about it and use it to make things
better. For site operations and more importantly for the human getting paged
when something does go wrong."
