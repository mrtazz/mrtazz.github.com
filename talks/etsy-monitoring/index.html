abstract: "It's no secret that at Etsy we are big fans of small, incremental
and frequent changes and tight feedback loops. This is how we make it possible
to deploy changes to our main codebase more than 50 times a day and also
safely apply changes to our infrastructure in a continuous fashion. It enables
us to rapidly fix bugs and roll out features in our application stack and
infrastructure. This however would not be possible without a tight feedback
loop and a myriad of monitoring tools that keep us informed about changes and
possible problems in every nook and cranny of the Etsy stack, no matter if
it's a network change event, systems or application level performance or how
bad the last week of on-call rotation was."
