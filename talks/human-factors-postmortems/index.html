abstract: "Our daily work takes place in a myriad of systems. They are
comprised of software, hardware and humans. And everybody who has worked with
complex systems at any scale knows: Failure is not an option, it's inevitable.

At Etsy we are embracing the fact that failures happen and that the only way
to understand how the accident happened is to investigate it without blaming
the humans involved. This is why we have a blameless postmortem for every
outage that occurs. It is an open meeting and everybody is invited to join and
find out what happened and how we can make the system safer.

This talk will explain how postmortems at Etsy are conducted and how we
maintain and scale the process as the team grows and new people start. It will
go over the tools we built and utilize to make postmortems efficient and also
share the learnings from each one with all the people in the company."
