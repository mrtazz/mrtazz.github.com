abstract: "At Etsy we have over 100 engineers deploying more than 40 times a day. This
culture of continuously deploying small change sets enables us to build and
release robust features all while serving over a billion page views per month.
In order to make sure we can keep up this pace, we have development and
deployment infrastructure in place that makes it comfortable and simple to make
changes. So simple that as an engineer at Etsy you deploy the site on your
first day - even if you're a dog."
