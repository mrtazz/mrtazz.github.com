abstract: "The Etsy DevTools team was created to foster collaboration between
engineering and operations and also between different teams within
engineering. We provide the tools to make it easy for everyone to deploy,
reaching from deployment tools to developer VMs and CI infrastructure
automation. Our main concern is to make processes fast and simple to enable
developers to do their work with maximum happiness.

The talk will be about what are the main concerns of the DevTools team and its
place between Engineering and Operations. I will give examples of how
processes were improved and how we introduced tools which make it simple and
safe to give developers access to production servers and data without causing
ops headaches."
