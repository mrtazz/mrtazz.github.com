abstract: "At Etsy about 150 engineers deploy a single monolithic application
more than 60 times a day. This process of deploying small changesets
continuously enables us to build up and release robust features and detect and
fix bugs extremely fast. All while serving over a billion page views per
month. Developing and deploying at such a high velocity however only works
because product developers and designers, infrastructure and operations
engineers and the security team work closely together. We have an extremely
open culture of sharing (inside and outside the company) and make sure we run
into as few surprises as possible by bringing everybody on the same page about
changes."
