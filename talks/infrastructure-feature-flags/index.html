abstract: "At Etsy we run our production stack exclusively on physical
hardware and have (including developer and CI VMs) about 1000 nodes managed
with a single Chef server running the same cookbooks across development and
production nodes. We have built the knife-spork plugin to support our workflow
and have 30 engineers making changes about 20 times a day. While this setup
keeps configuration changes and package installations consistent across our
network, it makes it harder to gradually roll out and test changes on a per
node or role basis. In the talk our general workflow will be introduced and
explained and how we enable engineers to frequently roll out small changes.
Following the general introduction, our workflow for testing changes will be
discussed and the library we wrote to enable config flags and gradual roll
outs for our infrastructure within our chef recipes."
